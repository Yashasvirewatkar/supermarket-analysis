supermarket analysis using python libraries
### Project: Supermarket Analysis

In this project, titled "Supermarket Analysis," we utilized the Anaconda Jupyter library in Python, employing several key libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and NumPy.

*Steps Undertaken:*

1. *Data Upload and Basic Understanding:*
   - Imported the dataset and performed an initial exploration to understand its structure and content.

2. *Data Type and Information Check:*
   - Verified the data types of each column and gathered basic statistical information.

3. *Data Processing:*
   - Checked for missing values and confirmed the dataset was complete.
   - Ensured data consistency and conducted feature engineering and execution.
   - Converted column types as needed.

4. *Data Cleaning:*
   - Removed the 'city' column since each branch corresponded to a city, simplifying the dataset.

5. *Descriptive Statistics:*
   - Generated a summary of descriptive statistics to capture essential insights about the data.

6. *Visualization:*
   - Created subplots and boxplots to visualize various aspects of the data and uncover underlying patterns.

7. *Sales Analysis:*
   - Calculated total and average sales for the company and each branch.
   - Identified the hot selling branch, particularly branch C, and investigated the reasons behind its performance.

8. *Revenue and Trend Analysis:*
   - Determined the highest revenue month for the company and for each city and branch.
   - Analyzed average sales of each branch on a monthly basis and observed sales trends over three months.

This comprehensive analysis provided valuable insights into the sales performance and trends of the company, highlighting key areas for strategic focus and potential improvement.
